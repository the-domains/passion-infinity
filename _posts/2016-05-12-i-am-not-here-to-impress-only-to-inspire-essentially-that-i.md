I AM not here to impress only to Inspire. Essentially that is the essence of life. I AM infinitely passion∞ about many of life's wonders especially the Divine element within all. I find joy in exploring every aspect of the Cosmic Breath which creates all physicality. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ab7c6b51-f98c-48bd-a5c0-5717e6fd59d5.jpg)

Let me take you on a magical journey into my Mind and likewise into the Mind's of the many beautiful souls who inspire me. Some of my favorite things include nature, music, art, photography, science, Vortex Based Mathematics, self-development, reading, writing, ancient wisdom and practices, holistic health and wellness, natural living through harmony and simplicity and much more. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ca5fd071-4679-4501-8ff2-d8f98fc5687e.jpg)

If I had to sum it all up into one word I'd choose the word Creator. In my experience Divine presence and Universal Law is undeniable and verifiable and I would like to highlight our Creator's Creation as well as humankind's co-creations. Unique and authentic, we all have equal potential however, what we DO with what we have been given determines our success and overall happiness. Life is a GIFT and I have evidence to prove it! ;) Mahalo and Thank You for joining me on this magical journey in **LOVE.**
